OpenAI Cookbook: Building a Bring Your Own Browser for real-time information
https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/third_party/web_search_with_google_api_bring_your_own_browser_tool

Zixuan Notes: Create AI that can provide specific methods/models needed for financial problems. eg.Discount cash flow
Generate models in excel or csv file that can be downloaded, user can work directly from there

11/17 Notes (Chatbot)
Data/Technologies/Softwares:
- OpenAI (create conversation; make inferences; feed in large quantities of data)
- yfinance (collect stock data)
- alphavantage (collect news data)
- Website for the generative ai feature

Things we can create:
1. text-based chatbot
	- ask questions about industries
	- ask questions about companies
	- ask to make a prediction
	- ask to analyze data (user uploads, yfinance collects)
	- generate graphs

                 You are an intelligent assistant tasked with making a decision. You will base your decision 
                on input data that a user sends. The following decisions are as follows:
                A: the user would like textual information about news sentiment; information 
                about a company, industry, or general discipline in finance or economics; general 
                information that can be found through stock news or financial journalist websites.
                B: the user would like a graph visualization generated using the matplotlib.pyplot 
                library. The visualization will be dependent on user query and data received.
                C: the user would like to seek insight from either user input data or data collected 
                from external sources, such as AlphaVantage and/or Yahoo Finance. 
                Your response will be either A,B, or C, depending on which task the user would 
                like accomplished. Here is the following task received from the user: {INSERT_USER_PROMPT_HERE}.
                Return only the label as your responseâ€“nothing else.
